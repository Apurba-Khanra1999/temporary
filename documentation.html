    <p>In today’s fast-paced digital world, staying organized and productive is key to managing tasks and information efficiently. This web application is designed to optimize productivity by offering a versatile platform for saving and organizing text, managing tasks, and maintaining focus. With features like persistent data storage, task management, and a unique tab-based text panel, this app is an all-in-one tool to enhance your workflow. Whether you’re working on multiple projects or need to quickly store information, this app ensures that everything is accessible and well-organized.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1 class="font-extrabold text-3xl mb-8">Key Features</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Persistent Data Storage</strong> <br> 
            <ul>
                <li>Any text you copy and paste into the app is saved automatically for future use. This data persists even after you close your browser or restart your system.</li>
                <li>If your device goes into sleep mode, the data remains intact and accessible. However, if the system is powered down, the saved content is cleared.</li>
                <li>This ensures that your important text snippets and notes are always available when you need them, without the fear of losing them after closing the app.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Task Management with To-Do List</strong> <br> 
            <ul>
                <li>The integrated to-do list feature helps you stay on top of your tasks. You can add, prioritize, and track tasks, marking them as complete once finished.</li>
                <li>This feature is designed to make it easier to manage your daily responsibilities and ensure that nothing is forgotten or overlooked.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>One of the most powerful and unique features of this app is the tab-based text panel. Much like the tabs in Google Chrome, you can have multiple tabs open at the same time, each holding its own content.</li>
                <li>You can rename each tab according to your preference, making it easy to categorize and differentiate between different sets of information. For example, you could have separate tabs for "Project A," "Ideas," "Work Notes," and so on.</li>
                <li>The drag-and-drop functionality allows you to rearrange the tabs, providing flexibility in how you organize your content. You can easily organize your tabs based on priority or personal preference.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Productivity-Focused Design</strong> <br> 
            <ul>
                <li>The app is designed to maximize productivity. With its simple and minimalistic interface, the app ensures that users can focus on their tasks and data without unnecessary distractions.</li>
                <li>The user-friendly interface is intuitive, enabling anyone to use the app effectively, regardless of their technical skill level.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Download and Reset Features</strong> <br> 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Download Content : </strong>Users can download all saved text content to their local system. This provides a quick way to back up or export data for offline use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reset Text Panel : </strong>The app includes a reset button that clears the current text from the panel, allowing users to start fresh whenever needed.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Future Enhancements:</strong> <br> 
            <ul>
                <li>The development team is actively working on several exciting new features, such as account creation, cloud synchronization, and enhanced task management tools to provide an even better user experience.</li>
            </ul>

<section>
    <h2 class="font-extrabold text-3xl mb-8">Troubleshooting</h2>
    <h3>1. Data Not Saving:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that your browser allows local storage. If local storage is disabled, the app won't be able to save your data.</li>
            <li>Make sure you're not running your browser in incognito or private mode, as this can also disable data storage.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>2. Task Reminders Not Triggering:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that your browser's notification settings are enabled to allow task reminders. If notifications are not enabled, you won’t receive alerts about upcoming tasks.</li>
        </ul>
</section>
